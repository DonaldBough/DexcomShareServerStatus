# Why Does this Project Exist?
In November of 2019, Dexcom Share Servers went down causing many children and adults with diabetes to be unable receive life saving alerts on low blood sugar while asleep. Dexcom does have a server uptime page, but this was not update until HOURS after the incident. The Nightscout foundation requested a project on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NightscoutFoundation/posts/3170040823071192), like this, be created to solve this problem.
